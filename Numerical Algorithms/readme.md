All these projects includes finding roots of systems of algebraic equations, numerical
interpolation and extrapolation of data, numerical differentiation and integration, Fourier
transforms, numerical simulations of systems governed by differential equations as well as
common techniques for analyzing and plotting data.The aims that I have achieved are:

● The advantages and limitations of common numerical techniques

● Practice writing flexible, efficient, and practical code in a modern language

● Get acquainted with modern software development tools and systems

● Learn common techniques for analyzing and plotting data

● Practice writing reports in the scientific style

 By acomplishing these projects I have gain experience with programming in carrying out
computational tasks.
